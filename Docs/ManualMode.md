## <a id="manual"> Manual mode
Starting version `6.13.0`, we support a manual mode to seperate the initialization of the AppsFlyer SDK and the start of the SDK.</br>
In this case, the AppsFlyer SDK won't start automatically, giving the developer more freedom when to start the AppsFlyer SDK.</br>
Please note that in manual mode, the developer is required to implement the API `AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().start(Activity activity)` in order to start the SDK.</br> 
You should set this mode before registering the `MobileCore` Extensions in `Application`.<br>
If you are using CMP to collect consent data this feature is needed. See explanation [here](./SendConsentForDMACompliance.md).
### Example:  
```kotlin
AppsflyerAdobeExtension.manual = true
``` 
Please look at the example below to see how to start SDK once you want.</br>
Keep in mind you shouldn't put the `start()` on a lifecycle method.</br>
To start the AppsFlyer SDK, use the `start()` API, like the following :  
```kotlin
AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().start(this)
```
