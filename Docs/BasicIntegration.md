## <a id="init-sdk"> ðŸš€ Initializing the SDK
    
Register the AppsFlyer extension from your `Application` class, alongside the Adobe SDK initialisation code: 
```java
@Override  
public void onCreate() {  
  super.onCreate();  
  
  MobileCore.setApplication(this);  
  MobileCore.setLogLevel(LoggingMode.DEBUG);  
  ...
  try {
  ...
  AppsFlyerAdobeExtension.registerExtension();
  ...
  }
}
```

In Addition to adding the init code, the settings inside the launch dashboard must be set.
